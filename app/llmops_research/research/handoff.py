"""Handoff notes between the daily research roles.

The roles run one after another, each in a fresh session: without notes, one role cannot tell the role that owns a
finding about it ("the Bedrock page lists a new model, but its vendor facts are the vendor-API role's"), and what one run
could not confirm or did not reach is invisible to the others and to tomorrow's run.

* After a role run - accepted or not - a small record is written next to the run records, in the same result store
  (``OUTPUT_URI``, S3 or a folder): ``handoff/<YYYY-MM-DD Asia/Taipei>/<HHMMSS>-<role>-<runId>.json`` with the run's
  status, summary, ``unverified`` lines, ``leads`` (findings for another role, proposal.py) and ``notReached`` (the
  ``checked`` entries whose result says "not reached: ..." or "skipped: ...").
* At the start of a role run the newest records of the day are read back (the first role of the day - no record yet -
  and the overview roles also get yesterday's leads and not-reached items; every role gets the leads addressed to it and
  its own not-reached items of yesterday) and rendered into the task brief as a DATA block.

The notes were written by earlier model runs from web pages: they are data, never instructions.  Every string is one
line, bounded and quoted; text that reads like an instruction to an AI is withheld (and the run is marked for a person);
the number of records and the size of the block are bounded.  Reading or writing notes never fails a run.

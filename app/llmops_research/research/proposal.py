"""Validate a research proposal *before* it leaves the agent.

The model proposes; this module decides.  A proposal is accepted only when

* it applies cleanly to a copy of the portal data and the copy still passes the portal's own
  JSON Schema + cross-file checks (no *new* problems);
* every operation cites evidence recorded earlier in the same run -- verbatim quotes from pages
  the agent really fetched;
* every date, number and software version that an operation really adds or changes is stated by ONE cited quote that
  (a) has the value, (b) has it on a line that is about the record it is written to - the model named there, in an
  earlier line of the quote or in the headings the quote stands under, and no other model named on that line - and
  (c) comes from a page whose tier is at least what the place demands: the ``verification`` label the value leans on,
  or the fixed floor of a place that carries no label.  A value in one quote and a tier in another do not add up;
* "really": the difference the operation makes to the data, whatever it is spelled as - a value copied from another
  record is new where it lands;
* a label that is raised re-asserts what stands under it, citations keep a page of the label's tier, and new sources
  are pages that were fetched - titled, typed and attributed from the page and its domain, never by the model;
* portal-specific rules hold (lifecycle ``conflicting`` dates, digest items that cite what the run read, ...);
* one operation changes one thing (an operation that rewrites many existing values is sent back to be split) and is
  about the data as it is today, not about what an earlier operation of the same proposal left behind; time stamps are
  the harness's to write, and a file or a record is only called "re-verified today" when its sources were read.

Everything here is deterministic; no model is involved.

What cannot be compared with a quote by a program - a status, a yes/no, a category, the wording of a note - is not
pretended to be checked: the validator makes sure the cited evidence is about the right record and of the right tier,
says so in a warning, and the publishing pipeline keeps such a change of an existing record for a person.

What the validator could not settle is handed on in the proposal: ``validation.flags`` (instruction-like text) and
``validation.asOfCoverage`` / ``validation.lastVerifiedCoverage`` (how many of the cited sources were read).  The
publishing pipeline computes its own gates from the real difference and only ever uses these to be stricter.
